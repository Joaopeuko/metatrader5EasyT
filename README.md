# WARNING!

Now that I have your attention I would like you to reflect about the fact that **$1.00 Dollar** might be **not** 
that **much** to you, but **you, an incredible person**, combined to other's **amazing Sponsors**, can **finance** this 
project, and it will **allows me** to constantly **improve and maintain** it, **and, I am not asking that much**.

Here is my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/joaopeuko) link.

  - _Yeah, I would like to do that, but I do not have that kind of money._ 

That is Ok, and, there are many ways you can help me, here is a list:

  - **Star** this project on GitHub.
  - **Share** this project.
  - **Open an account with Binance referral link**:
    - When you open an account on Binance you help me when you trade!
    - Some of your tax paid returns for you and part goes for me.
    - Below you can see the percentage cash back for me and for you, and you trade:
